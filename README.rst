A very basic MUD engine in Python
=================================

This started as an experiment.  Probably will end up no where but some
random white expanse.

The server may not be able to be killed unless some connection to it has
been made first, so be warned if you tried to ``start`` and ``drive`` it
from the mud controller script.
