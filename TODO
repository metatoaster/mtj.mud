Exits
=====
- Two types
- One that will be like a double link list
- The other will be a one way
- Two way will be like this:

- Standard two way exit?
Exit2
  exit = [room1, room2] (invariant len(Exit2) == 2)
  exit.enter(person, person.room(?)) (other params generalized?)
    # enter the other room

  both rooms will contain the relevant exits
  room1.exits = {'south': exit, ...}
  room2.exits = {'north': exit, ...}

- One way exit
Exit1
  exit = room
  exit.enter(person, person.room)


Event queue
===========

This like reader/writer problem
- each soul act as a reader (multiple readers)
- the event processor is the writer
